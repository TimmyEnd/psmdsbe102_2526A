# PSMDSBE102-HandsOn4.1

In compliance with Hands-on 4.1 requirements. This project was completed for Special Topics course. It covers model training, hyperparameter tuning, experiment tracking, and deployment preparation using Python, Scikit-Learn, Ray Tune, and MLflow.

This repository contains the full workflow for training and evaluating a credit-risk classification model. 

Key Components 

Data processing: Cleaning, feature engineering, scaling, and train-test split. 

Model training: Random Forest classifier optimized using Ray Tune with cross-validation. 

Hyperparameter tuning: Automated search using HyperOpt + AsyncHyperBand Scheduler. 

Experiment tracking: All runs logged to MLflow, including metrics, parameters, and final model artifacts.
